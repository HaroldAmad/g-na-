            <h2> What is Guitar Chord Chart </h2>
            <p> A guitar chord chart is a shorthand way of understanding which frets of which strings you should place your fingers on in order to play a specific chord. This diagram is displayed as a grid, consisting of vertical lines that represent the six strings of a guitar and horizontal lines that represent the frets on your guitar’s fretboard. The thicker black bar at the top of the diagram represents the guitar’s nut, giving you a visual starting point to discern the appropriate frets where you should place your fingers. </p>

        <h2> How to Read Guitar Chord Chart </h2>    
        <p> Whether you’re a beginner guitarist or a seasoned player, learning how to read a guitar chord chart can help you more easily play a variety of chords and chord shapes.  </p>
        
        <!-- Vertical and Horizontal Lines -->
        <div>
            <h3> Vertical and Horizontal Lines </h3>
            <p> The vertical lines of a chord chart represent each of the six strings of a guitar. From lowest to highest, they are:
                <ul>
                   <li> 6th (and lowest toned) string: low E  </li>  
                   <li> 5th string: A  </li>  
                   <li> 4th string: D  </li> 
                   <li> 3rd string: G  </li> 
                   <li> 2nd string: B  </li> 
                   <li> 1st (and highest toned) string high E </li>   
                </ul> </p>
            <p> While each vertical line of a chord chart represents each of the six strings, the horizontal lines of a chord chart represent the frets of a guitar. Each horizontal line is an indicator of which fret of each string you should place your finger on in order to play a given chord. </p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Numbers and Dots -->
        <div class="instructions_numberanddots">
            <div>
                <h3> Numbers and Dots  </h3>
                <p> Now that you know what the vertical and horizontal lines mean on a chord chart, it’s time to get down to what the numbers inside each of the dots on the corresponding strings and frets mean. Whenever you see a number inside a dot on a given correspondence point on a chord chart, it’s an indicator of what finger you should use to place on a given fret or across a series of frets in order to sound the correct note.
                    Each of the given numbers inside a dot on a given fret line correspond, as follows: </p>
                    
                <ul> 
                    <li> 1 = Index finger  </li>
                    <li>  2 = Middle finger  </li>
                    <li> 3 = Ring finger  </li>
                    <li> 4 = Pinky finger </li>
                </ul>     
            </div>
            <img class="instructions_fingering" src="pictures/howitworksrightfingering.png">
        </div>
    
        <!-- X's and O's -->
        <div>
            <h3> X’s and O’s </h3>
            <p> When looking at a chord chart, you may see “X’s and “O”s above the thick black line that represents the nut of your guitar. It’s not a wonky version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Rather, it’s shorthand for which strings you should strum and which strings you should mute when playing a given chord.
                An “X” above a string indicates that the string should be muted when strumming a chord. An “O” above a string means that the string should be played in the open position (without a finger on any of the frets aligned with that string) in a given chord. These shorthand notations of “X’s and “O’s can help you easily see which strings you’ll need to omit from a strumming pattern, which strings are played in an open position, as well as which strings need you to place a finger on a given fret in order to strum a specific chord.
